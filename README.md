## Ace Analyzer (T9 Hackathon)

## Inspiration

The team's goal was to create a program that would teach players how to count cards in Blackjack without risking any real money.

## What it does

This project implements a GUI to allow the user to make decisions for their hand (stay, hit, split, double). The program then compares the player's hand with the dealer's and tells them if they won.

## How we built it

The trainer is a GUI program built using Python and Pygame.

## Challenges we ran into

The team faced various challenges while building the trainer, including testing their program and working with multiple live versions.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

For their first hackathon the team is proud that we were able to learn something new and create a program that shows a solid proof of concept of our goals in under 24 hours!

## What we learned

Both team members got more comfortable using Python while learning Pygame to support the GUI.

## What's next for The Dealer's Nightmare

Moving forward, the team plans to finish implementing the remaining blackjack functions and add basic strategy recommendations for the user, along with more advanced card counting functions. The Dealerâ€™s Nightmare is perfect for those interested in learning how to count cards in blackjack and is a great way to practice your skills and see if you have what it takes to beat the dealer at their own game.
